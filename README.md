# react-gauge-chart-nocss
Exact clone of react-gauge-chart https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-gauge-chart but with no css in the package - it was giving lots of grief on react v15 because of CSS. Visit that link for usage instructions. This repo is just an option of awesome lib **react-gauge-chart** for react v15, not claiming the copyright or anything

If you're using percentage text, add this to your mainb CSS file:
```
.percent-text{
  text-anchor: middle;
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```
